Terminal-based dungeon adventure game, made for our CS246 class in a week :D

Project structure inspiration: http://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/07/03/a-simple-c-plus-plus-project-structure/

This code isn't the cleanest or most adventurous, but we working according to cc3k project guidelines and the game is pretty fun :)

Disclaimer: Please don't copy this code for your own school assignments, that would be totally not cool.
